	<h2>Effect Of Climate Change to Rwanda And AFrica in General</h2>
	<h3>Climate change and diminishing food security</h3>
<p>
Rising temperatures are affecting our climate and as a result, it affects our environment and the functions it delivers. One such key function is nutrient replenishment. Climate change puts nutrient cycles at risk, which has a knock-on effect on soil fertility.

Dry field
Such effect is not only important in terms of preserving biodiversity and habitats, but it is also critical for agricultural activity and food security. More specifically, as soils become dryer with climate change, this impacts nitrogen and carbon concentrations which are the building blocks for plant growth [1].
 
	</p>


	<h3>Climate change and worse air pollution</h3>
	<p>
Climate change also has an impact on air quality. According to a recent study, by the end of the century, more than half of the world’s population will be exposed to increasingly stagnant atmospheric conditions, with the tropics and subtropics bearing the brunt of the poor air quality [3].

Air stagnation results from three meteorological incidents: light winds, a stable lower atmosphere and a day with little or no precipitation to wash away pollution. If greenhouse gases were to rise significantly in the future, estimates indicate that 55% of the global population will experience more air stagnation by 2099.

Large areas of India, Mexico and the Amazon could see up to 40 more stagnant air days per year compared to the average annual tally from 1986 to 2005 [3].
</p>

<h3>Climate change and disappearing wildlife</h3><p>
One of the first things to be hit by the effects of climate change is our wildlife. According to international experts, global warming is likely to be the greatest cause of species extinctions this century with estimates indicating that a 1.5°C average rise may put 20-30% of species at risk of extinction [4].

A logging site
What is particularly worrying is that it is not just individual species that will be lost, but ecosystems as a whole will suffer. A lot of our ecosystems are already straining to adapt to deforestation and other types of pollution. The impact of adapting to climate change is therefore likely to be the straw to break the camel’s back.

<h3>Climate change and problems with water quality</h3><p>
Climate change is having serious impacts on the world’s water systems through flooding, droughts, as well as more extreme rainfall patterns. This creates further pressures on rivers and lakes that supply water for people and animals.

What is more, the world’s oceans are also put at risk. Oceans are considered “carbon sinks” because they absorb huge amounts of carbon dioxide, limiting its potential to contribute to further global warming.

Healthy coral reef habitat
However, increased water temperatures and ever-increasing carbon dioxides concentrations mean that oceans are changing and becoming more acidic. This affects fish and other marine organisms living there. Coral reefs are particularly at risk. Sensitive coral species and algae are starved of oxygen, which leads to a dramatic bleaching and possibly even the death of the coral.

It is a sobering thought that only 5% one of the most biodiverse and unique ecosystems in the world, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, will be still intact in 2050 [4].

In the end, we must keep reminding ourselves what climate change and its impacts mean for our planet and our own lives. Regrettably, climate change is not something we can afford to ignore any longer.
